# ExpensesandBudgeting
This code is currently still being worked on. It is going to rely on user input to calculate how much spending money the user will be able to have after all expenses are paid for. It will eventually calculate approximately how much tax will be applied to their income before it can be dispersed to their expenses. In the end, it will print out the total starting amount, how much the user is being taxed (and where the money is going), how much each of their expenses will cost, any additional expenses they add, and finally, how much spending money they'd have at the end.
